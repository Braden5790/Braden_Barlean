          <div class="body-text">I am set to graduate with a Master of Science in Engineering from Johns Hopkins University's Center for Bioengineering Innovation and Design in May 2023. While pursuing my master's degree, I worked in the United States to develop a more efficient incontinence management systems for geriatric patents both in nursing homes and at home. This project started with clinical needs identification and validation and then transitioned to product development. I also have been working in the global health space with ARISE (Accelerated, Realistic, Intelligent Simulation for Surgical Education), where we are working to expand laparoscopy, minimally invasive surgery, in low- and middle-income countries through our suite of surgical education products. The ARISE platform is designed to empower surgeons with the skills and knowledge they need to perform life-saving laparoscopic surgeries.</div>
          <div class="body-text">During my undergraduate years, I worked in a biomaterials laboratory where I was trying to occlude cerebral aneurysms using pentenoate-functionalized hyaluronic acid hydrogels. While I was working on and had a great interest in biomaterials sciences, I was also extremely interested in robotics and 3D printing. This led me to my school's Biomedical Engineering Society, where I had the opportunity to develop a robotic prosthetic hand. This robotic prosthetic is currently being used to teach students about coding, 3D printing, and bioelectricity.</div>
