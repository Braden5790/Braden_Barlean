        <div class="about-section-content">
          <div class="body-text">While my academic background is in biomedical engineering, my true passion lies in design engineering. Throughout my education and career, I have gravitated toward the creative process of solving complex problems through innovative design. From developing functional prototypes to optimizing products for manufacturability, I have continually sought opportunities to refine my skills as a design engineer. My experiences have allowed me to step beyond the biomedical field and focus on the principles of product design, precision, and functionality that define exceptional engineering. Today, I see myself not as a medical devices engineer, but as a design engineer committed to creating impactful, efficient, and user-focused solutions.</div>
          <div class="body-text">I earned a Master of Science in Engineering from Johns Hopkins University in May 2023, where I honed my skills in product design and development. During my graduate studies, I worked on creating an efficient, user-centered incontinence management system for geriatric patients. This project involved identifying and validating user needs, designing solutions that balanced functionality and manufacturability, and transitioning concepts into prototypes ready for testing.</div>
          <div class="body-text">I also contributed to ARISE (Accelerated, Realistic, Intelligent Simulation for Surgical Education), where I played a key role in designing and refining a suite of surgical education tools. These products were developed with an emphasis on scalability, durability, and cost-effectiveness to support laparoscopic training in low- and middle-income countries. My work required collaboration across teams and disciplines, demonstrating my ability to create practical, impactful designs that address real-world challenges.</div>
          <div class="body-text">As an undergraduate, I worked in a biomaterials lab exploring solutions for cerebral aneurysm occlusion. While this experience strengthened my analytical and problem-solving skills, I also pursued my passion for design engineering through robotics and 3D printing. As part of my universityâ€™s Biomedical Engineering Society, I developed a robotic prosthetic hand, focusing on its functionality, manufacturability, and educational impact. This project allowed me to apply design principles to create a robust tool that is now used to teach students about coding, 3D printing, and bioelectricity.</div>
